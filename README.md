<h1 align="center">BCH_Low_Blood_Pressure_Analysis Project</h1>

## üìå Introduction
During pediatric surgeries, **low blood pressure** can pose serious risks. This project analyzes blood pressure data to detect cases where **systolic BP dropped below safe thresholds for at least 14 minutes**, helping medical teams assess and mitigate risks.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Problem Statement
BCH medical team faced a complex data challenge:

- They had two separate datasets: patient demographics and minute-by-minute blood pressure readings
  
- Identifying low blood pressure isn't a one-size-fits-all approach, as different age groups have different blood pressure thresholds. And the threshold for "low blood pressure" changes based on a child's age:

- Children under 44 months: Low BP is 46 mmHg or below
- 
- Children 44 months and older: Low BP is 55 mmHg or below
  
- They needed to find continuous periods of low blood pressure lasting 14 minutes or more
