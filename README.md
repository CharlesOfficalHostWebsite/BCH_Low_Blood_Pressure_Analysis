<h1 align="center">BCH_Low_Blood_Pressure_Analysis Project</h1>

## Problem Statement
The challenge is that hospitals collect thousands of readings per patient, and finding extended low BP periods manually is like searching for a needle in a haystack. This project was born from the need to automate that search — by using age-based medical thresholds to scan for any patient who experienced 14 or more consecutive minutes of dangerously low BP during surgery.
