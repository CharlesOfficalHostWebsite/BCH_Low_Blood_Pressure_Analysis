<h1 align="center">BCH_Low_Blood_Pressure_Analysis Project</h1>

## 📌 Introduction
During pediatric surgeries, **low blood pressure** can pose serious risks. This project analyzes blood pressure data to detect cases where **systolic BP dropped below safe thresholds for at least 14 minutes**, helping medical teams assess and mitigate risks.

## ⚠️ Problem Statement
BCH medical team faced a complex data challenge:

- They had two separate datasets: patient demographics and minute-by-minute blood pressure readings
  
- Identifying low blood pressure isn't a one-size-fits-all approach, as different age groups have different blood pressure thresholds.
  
- They needed to find continuous periods of low blood pressure lasting 14 minutes or more

## 🎯 Objective
- Identify patients whose **blood pressure dropped dangerously low for 14+ minutes**.
- Generate a **report listing affected patients and duration of low BP events**.
- Provide **insights through visualizations** to help doctors analyze trends.
  
## 📌 Why This Project?
- **Increased focus on patient safety** in surgeries.
- **Large datasets make it difficult to track prolonged low BP cases manually**.
- **Improving real-time monitoring systems** can help prevent serious complications.
